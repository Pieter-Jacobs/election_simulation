This repo will be used to investigate the influence of strategic voting on democratic elections by using a simulation with multiple ageents having different political profiles. These agents will be used to see how the election results change when agents vote on parties that are not a perfect fit for their profile, but have similar ideas and a larger chance to end up governing the country.
